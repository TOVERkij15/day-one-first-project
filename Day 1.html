	<p> At 26 years old, I am like most trying to set my career path and settle down doing something I can be passionate about.  I did go to college where I earned a bachelor's degree in Liberal Studies and lots of wonderful student loans.  I have two cats (I am a cat lady).  The oldest one has only three legs and therefore tends to be pretty high maintenance.  I live with my Fiance and am proud to say that this year will be our tenth year together! </p>

	<p>I can honestly say that I have the best friends in the entire world.  They are my biggest supporters and closest family members.  Can you spot another classmate? </p>

	<ol>
		<li>Television/Movies: Huge fan of series (Breaking Bad, GOT,That 70's Show,etc.)</li>
		<li>Interior Design (Hobby and Passion)</li>
		<li>Books! If there is one huge thing you need to know about me, it is how much I love to read.  I like all types of genres.  I read based off my moods.  If I am in a good mood, I'll read a YA novel or fantasy based.  If I am in a serious mood, I'll read something historical or anything non-fiction.  If I am in a terrible mood, I'll pick up a thriller or something dealing with crime.  Reading to me is an escape and stress reliever.
